# AirQuality Weather App
This application tells users the air quality for any zip code they type into the search box(Only of US region). This project is built using Python Django Web framework on the backend and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript on the frontend with the help of AirNow's API (https://www.airnow.gov/) for air quality data.
